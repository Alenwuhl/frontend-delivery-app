# Futuristic Delivery App

## Overview

The **Futuristic Delivery App** is a project built with Flutter and Node.js, simulating an order process in a delivery application. This app serves as a personal project to demonstrate my skills and capabilities in mobile app development. The design was crafted by a designer specifically for testing purposes.

## Features

- **User Registration and Login**: Users can register and log in using their email and password or through various social media accounts.
- **Product Categories**: Currently, the only category with available products is "Ice Cream".
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add products to their cart and simulate a payment process using FaceID.
- **Order Simulation**: After placing an order, a timer simulates the delivery process. Once the timer finishes, the cart is cleared, and users can start a new order.
